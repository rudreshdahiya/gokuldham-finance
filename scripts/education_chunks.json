At the same time, there could be some not-so-common ones like starting one\u2019s own business or taking a sabbatical from work and fund one\u2019s higher education. Goal setting is a very important exercise while planning for investments. As seen above, all the financial goals are about the need for money that cannot be fulfilled through the inflow at that time.

Some of the examples of the same are the death of a family member, hospitalization, accident, theft, fire, etc. One cannot plan to fund the expenses associated with such events through investments, though we can create an emergency fund using some savings and investment products.

Mrs. D\u2019Souza\u2019s case is interesting since she has a need for income from investments in the immediate term, but the same must also continue for a long and uncertain period, as the income is required for life. Rabindra would also enter a similar situation on retirement. The retirement goal can be broken into two parts \u2013 accumulating a sum for retirement and then taking income out of the corpus thus accumulated. Another look at the two approaches to classify the goals indicates that the goals can be placed in the following matrix: Critically important (responsibilities or needs) Dreams Good-to-have Immediate term Near term Medium term Long term This looks very similar to the urgent v/s important matrix that Stephen Covey discussed in his bestseller \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d.",

Wisdom suggests that if one plans well for those important and not urgent tasks (and goals), life changes for the better. In order to achieve this, it is important to first classify the financial goals \u2013 those events in life in terms of timeline and importance in one\u2019s life. 1.1.4 Financial Goals, Time Horizon for their achievement and Inflation The next step would be to assign amounts to the financial goals. In the process of planning, this is an important question: How much would it cost? Shalini, the eight-year-old, wants to be a space scientist, for which she needs good quality education. How much would such education cost?",

How much would such education cost? Well, this question must be answered in terms of the amount needed when Shalini reaches college. And that is roughly a decade from now. In such a case, the costs are quite likely to move up. Such a rise in the cost of the goals is called inflation. It applies to many other areas of personal finance. This is known as inflation with respect to the goal value. Inflation adjustment for the goal values is critical, without which the entire planning can go haywire. The cost of education has been going up at a very fast pace over the last few decades. Similar is the case of the cost of healthcare, which can have a big impact on the expenses during the retirement years. 1.1.5 The Pool Approach Some people have a pool of savings / investment and meet their financial requirements from the pool.",

Case Study: In case of Shalini\u2019s higher education. Assume that the cost of her higher education is Rs. 50 lacs (in today\u2019s price), whereas Shalini would go to college 10 years later.

On the other hand, the immediate term and near-term goals may not have a big impact due to changes in price. As mentioned earlier, inflation is the rise in prices of various products, and services consumed. If the inflation is 6 percent p.a., the household expenses would be higher a year later in comparison to today\u2019s cost of living.

This does not look like much, but if the inflation stays at the same level, this family\u2019s monthly expenses would be roughly Rs. 53,725 after 10 years; and Rs. 96,214 after 20 years. There is one thing common in all these financial goals: a mismatch of cash flows. Either the expenses are far higher than the income at that point in time, or there is no income at the time of funding these goals. Since these are future goals, an investor may have time to accumulate one\u2019s savings; and grow them through appropriate investment avenues. 1.2 Savings or Investments? Before taking a look at various investment options available for an investor, some important questions need to be tackled.

Such clarification is warranted since many individuals use the two terms interchangeably. The word \u201csaving\u201d originates from the same root as \u201csafe\u201d. The safety of money is of critical importance here. Whereas, when one invests money, the primary objective typically is to earn profits. The important point to note here is that there is a trade-off between risk and return. The other difference is evident from the dictionary definition of \u201csaving\u201d\u2013 reduction in the amount of money used.

Thus, saving precedes investing. 1.2.1 Factors to evaluate investments The three most important factors to evaluate investments are safety, liquidity, and returns. In addition to these, there are few more parameters such as convenience, ticket size (or the minimum investment required), taxability of earnings, tax deduction, etc. These factors have been discussed below: Safety: This begins with the safety of capital invested.

The degree of ease is different across different categories, and even within the categories, the same could be different across products. Sometimes, the nature of the product could be such that selling it is difficult, whereas sometimes there could be some operational features, e.g., a lock-in for a certain period, after which one may be able to liquidate the investment; or a penalty for an early exit. While such a penalty does not hamper liquidity, it only lowers the investment returns. Another aspect that one may also want to look at is divisibility.",

Another aspect that one may also want to look at is divisibility. Is it possible to liquidate part of the investment or is it necessary to sell the whole thing? Returns: As seen earlier in the definition of investments, the major purpose is to get some returns from investment. Such returns may be in the form of regular (or periodic) income, also known as current income; and capital appreciation, or capital gains. The current income is receivable periodically, without having to sell the investment, whereas the capital gains can be realized only when one sells the investment. The exit charges or penalty would bring down the returns, as seen earlier. Hence, whenever there are any such charges for withdrawals (including early withdrawals), the same must be considered as a trade-off between liquidity and returns.",

Convenience: Any investment must be evaluated in terms of convenience with respect to investing, taking the money out\u2013fully or partially, as well as the investor\u2019s ability to conveniently check the value of the investment, as well as to receive the income. Ticket size: What is the minimum amount required for investment? There are some avenues where an investor can start investing amounts as small as Rs. 50 or Rs. 100, whereas some require more than Rs. 1 lakh, and sometimes more than Rs. 1 crore.

Taxability of income: What one retains after taxes is what matters, and hence, taxation of the earnings is another important factor that one must consider. While looking at the taxability of income, it is critical to evaluate various other factors, too, and not look at taxation in isolation.

In other words, if the investor sells the investment before maturity (or a certain minimum period), the investment returns may be taxable. Tax deduction: A related matter is the tax deduction that may be available in case of certain products. Such a deduction effectively increases the return on investment, since the same is  19 calculated after factoring the net amount invested. However, where a deduction is available, the product may have a lock-in period of certain years. Once again, this is a trade-off between liquidity and tax deduction.",

One also must consider the investor\u2019s situation while evaluating the avenues. 1.3 Different Asset Classes Various investment avenues can be grouped in various categories, called asset classes. An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics. There are four broad asset categories or asset classes, and then there are various subcategories, within each of these.

There could also be some interest payable on the amount borrowed. There are  21 various forms of borrowing, some of which are through marketable instruments like bonds and debentures3. There are many issuers of such papers, e.g., Companies, Union Government, State Governments, Municipal Corporations, banks, financial institutions, public sector enterprises, etc. Many bonds pay regular interest; thus, the investors can expect current income.

While the first is the desirable situation, the latter two are not. Credit risk is all about the possibility that the second or the third situation may arise. Any delay or default in the repayment of principal or payment of interest may arise due to a problem with one or both of the two reasons: (1) the ability of the borrower, or (2) the intention of the borrower.

It does not matter whether these opinions are based on facts, or otherwise. Since the opinions may change very fast, the prices may fluctuate more in comparison to the change  26 in facts related to security. Such fluctuations are also referred to as volatility.

This risk affects the value of bonds/debt instruments more directly than stocks. Any reduction in interest rates will increase the value of the instrument and vice versa. While most investors are familiar with the concept of debentures, they normally buy and hold these bonds till maturity. On maturity of the bond, they get the maturity amount, since it is part of the bond agreement (assuming the company does not default on the commitment).

When the interest rates in the economy increase, the prices of existing bonds decrease, since they continue to offer the old interest rates. Assume that a bond was issued at Rs. 1000 for one year, and it offered an interest rate of 8 percent. Immediately after the bond was issued, the interest rates in the economy increased, and new bonds are now offering 8.5 percent interest. In such a case, the earlier bond becomes less attractive.

However, this may also mean giving up the opportunity to benefit out of the said investment. Many experts recommend that one should avoid the investment avenues that one does not understand. \u2022 Take a position to benefit from some event/development An investor can also take an investment position in anticipation of some developments in the market.

Some important biases are discussed below: \u2022 Availability Heuristic Most people rely on examples or experiences that come to mind immediately while analyzing any data, information, or options to choose from.

In order to ascertain the risk appetite, the following must be evaluated: \u2022 The need to take risks \u2022 The ability to take risks, and \u2022 The willingness to take risks Out of the above, the need to take risks arises when the investor needs higher returns to reach one\u2019s goals.

In other words, it is an approach to maintain a target allocation across various asset categories. Such a target asset allocation across the asset categories is decided based on the analysis of the needs and risk appetite of the investor.

The purpose of such an approach may be to take advantage of the opportunities presented by various markets at different points in time, but the primary reason for doing so is to improve the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio.

If equity valuation is stretched, it may be reduced somewhat. Rebalancing An investor may select any of the asset allocation approaches, however, there may be a need to make modifications in the asset allocations. Let us first start with the strategic allocation. In that case, the asset allocation is likely to change periodically, since the different assets may not move together in the same direction and may not move equally, even when the direction is the same.

Their argument is that the asset allocation was decided by an analysis of the needs and risk appetite of the investor. We need to reduce the allocation to the risky asset if that has gone up. On the other hand, if the allocation has gone down in the asset that has the potential to generate higher returns, we need to correct that as well.  32 Such a rebalancing offers a huge benefit \u2013 it makes the investor buy low and sell high.

Let us understand this through an example: Assume that the target asset allocation for an investor is 50:50 between asset categories A and B. A year later, asset category A went up by 20 percent, whereas asset B went down by 5 percent. In such a case, the allocation has deviated from the target. If we started investment of Rs. 1,000 each in both the cases, the value in both the cases would stand at Rs. 1,200 in asset A and Rs. 950 in asset B, with the total portfolio value at Rs. 2,150. The current allocation stands at 55.81 percent in asset A and 44.19 percent in asset B. This needs to be restored to 50:50. That means selling some part of the investment in asset A (worth Rs. 125) and buying some in asset B. As we can see here the asset A, which has gone up, is sold; and asset B, which has gone down, is bought.

While that is fine for the purpose of discussions, technically it is not correct. As a mutual fund distributor, it is critical to understand the difference between the two concepts. When someone says that one has invested in a mutual fund scheme, often, the scheme is perceived to be competing with the traditional instruments of investment, viz. equity shares, debentures, bonds, etc. The reality is that one invests in these instruments through a mutual fund scheme. In other words, through investment in a mutual fund, an investor can get access to equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities, that may otherwise be unavailable to them and avail of the professional fund management services offered by an asset management company.

The projects that are facilitated through such financing, offer employment to people; the income they earn helps them buy goods and services offered by other companies, thus supporting projects of these goods and services companies. Thus, overall economic development is promoted. As a large investor, the mutual funds can keep a check on the operations of the investee company, and their corporate governance and ethical standards.

Mutual funds can also act as a market stabilizer, in countering large inflows or outflows from foreign investors. Mutual funds are therefore viewed as a key participant in the capital market of any economy. In 2022, when foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold heavily in the equity market, Mutual Fund industry provided a counterforce in the form of demand for equity stocks by virtue of fresh inflows into schemes / funds. 2.1.2 Investment Objectives of Mutual Funds Mutual funds seek to mobilize money from all possible investors.",

Each such pool of money is called a mutual fund scheme. Every scheme has a pre-announced investment objective. Investors invest in a mutual fund scheme whose investment objective reflects their own needs and preference.

Recurring Expenses The fees or commissions paid to various mutual fund constituents come out of the expenses charged to the mutual fund scheme. These are known as recurring expenses. These expenses are charged as a percentage to the scheme\u2019s assets under management (AUM). The scheme expenses are deducted while calculating the NAV.

The relative size of mutual fund companies/asset management companies is assessed by their assets under management (AUM). When a scheme is first launched, assets under management is the amount mobilized from investors. Thereafter, if the scheme performs well and is marketed well, its AUM goes up and vice versa. Further, if the scheme is open to receiving money from investors even post-NFO, then such contributions from investors boost the AUM. Conversely, if the scheme pays any money to the investors, either as a dividend or as consideration for buying back the units of investors, the AUM falls.

Affordable Portfolio Diversification Investing in the units of a scheme provides investors the exposure to a range of securities held in the investment portfolio of the scheme in proportion to their holding in the scheme.

Instead, they can achieve the diversification through an investment of less than thousand rupees in a mutual fund scheme.

Therefore, an individual investor has no control over the costs in a scheme. SEBI has however imposed certain limits on the expenses that can be charged to any scheme. These limits, which vary with the size of assets and the nature of the scheme, are discussed later.

Although some unit-holders may exit from the scheme, wholly or partly, the scheme continues operations with the remaining investors. The scheme does not have any kind of time frame in which it is to be closed. The ongoing entry and exit of investors imply that the unit capital in an open-ended fund would keep changing on a regular basis.

In effect they are like a normal mutual fund but the only difference being that while an open-ended fund would have a single NAV at the end of the day at which all the transactions take place the situation is different for the ETF. Since the ETF is traded for the entire day, it gives multiple opportunities and prices at which the investor can either enter or exit the fund. This is similar to any other listed securities where there are multiple prices at which transactions take place and this is witnessed for an ETF too. ETFs provide additional liquidity for investors and enable them to take benefit of changes that take place in prices during the day. The downside to this is that the prices might fluctuate quite a bit and there might be a big gap with the NAV of the fund too.",

They are ideal for investors seeking low-risk, income-generating investments with a  54 defined horizon, such as retirement planning or children's education. Additionally, TMFs provide liquidity through listing on stock exchanges, allowing investors to exit before the maturity date if needed. In the last few years, the Indian mutual fund industry has witnessed growing interest in these funds. TMFs offer benefits like predictable returns, low credit risk, tax efficiency, and liquidity, making them an attractive option for investors seeking stable, long-term investments.

Such schemes have restrictions pertaining to their investment universe, which is also a function of the credit rating assigned by these agencies. In case of Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), the AMC is allowed to disclose the proposed rating profile of the scheme before the portfolio is constructed.

Like a bank account holder does not transact directly with the head office of the bank, but only with the branch; an investor does not deal with the depository, but with the depository participant.

Currently, there are four regulators, viz., 1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that regulates the banking system, as well as money markets; 2.

Therefore, robust operational risk management systems are warranted and SEBI has issued detailed guidelines for governance of these aspects. SEBI regulations and circulars also mandate exposure limits for investments by mutual fund schemes to ensure that investors get a diversified portfolio and the schemes remain true-to-label. These regulations also cover creation of segregated portfolios in the event of any credit event in debt mutual fund schemes.",

SEBI has revised the time limit for the disclosure of NAV of Mutual Fund Schemes investing overseas.40 With the availability of historical NAV, an investor should also be able to calculate how a scheme has performed over whatever period one wants to check for.

While the category of distributors is also varied, the platforms used are also many. Funds may be distributed through the traditional method of using paper-based application forms, or through electronic platforms such as websites, mobile phones and stock exchanges.

Both Life Insurance Corporation of India Ltd (LIC), and Unit Trust of India (UTI) depended on a huge force of individual agents. While the two institutions made various products and solutions available, the agency force (i.e., individual agents) ensured these products reached the households. These same agents also distributed the small savings products, and to that extent, they played a huge role in bringing household savings into financial products. Almost all of them operated as individuals, and single-handedly, without any staff or skeleton staff, mainly to handle the paperwork.

The commission payable is calculated on the daily balances and paid out periodically to the distributor as per the agreement entered into with AMC. The trail commission is normally paid by the AMC on a quarterly basis or monthly basis. Since it is calculated on net assets, distributors benefit from increase in net assets arising out of valuation gains in the market. For example, suppose an investor has bought 1000 units at Rs. 10 each. The distributor who procured the investment may have been paid an initial commission calculated as a percentage on 1000 units X Rs. 10 i.e., Rs 10,000.",

In short, trail commission depends on the NAV. Further, unlike products like insurance, where agent commission is paid for a limited number of years, a mutual fund distributor is paid trail commission for as long as the investor\u2019s money is held in the fund. Such indexing of agent commissions to the current value of the investment, and the absence of a time limitation to earning it, are unique benefits that make it attractive for distributors to sell mutual funds.

The primary objective behind the introduction of these principles was to ensure fair treatment to all investors including existing investors as well as investors seeking to purchase or redeem units of mutual funds in all schemes at all points of time.

The mutual funds also have to clearly indicate the distinction that when a distributable surplus is paid how much of this is the appreciation of NAV and how much is capital distribution. 7.4 Concept of Entry and Exit Load and its impact on NAV A distinctive feature of open-ended schemes is the ongoing facility to acquire new units from the scheme (sale transaction) or sell units back to the scheme (re-purchase transaction). In the past, schemes were permitted to keep the Sale Price higher than the NAV. The difference between the Sale Price and NAV was called the \u201centry load\u201d. If the NAV of a scheme was Rs 11.00 per unit, and it were to charge entry load of 1 percent, the Sale Price would be Rs 11 + 1 percent on Rs 11 i.e., Rs 11.11. Since entry load is no longer permitted, the Sale Price is same as the NAV. Schemes are permitted to keep the re-purchase Price lower than the NAV. The difference between the NAV and re-purchase Price is called the \u201cexit load\u201d.",

For instance, load would be 4 percent if the investor were to exit in year 1, 3 percent if the investor were to exit in year 2, and so on.  151 Earlier, schemes had the flexibility to differentiate between different classes of investors within the same scheme, by charging them different levels of load.

However, the dividend would be paid to the investor after the deduction of dividend distribution tax from the scheme itself. To that extent, although the dividend was tax-free, the NAV reduced to the extent of the dividend as well as the dividend distribution tax. Thus, this tax had an impact on the investor\u2019s after-tax returns. In the Union Budget presented by the finance minister in February 2020, the situation changed.",

This means the dividends would be taxable in the hands of the recipient at the applicable tax rate. What is the change for those who opted for Income distribution cum capital withdrawal option in mutual funds? In the new regime, tax on dividend would be a function of the applicable rate of tax based on the total income for the year, and hence the tax rate goes up for those with higher income. This means those who were in higher tax earlier might have paid a lower tax on the dividend income in comparison to their nominal rate of tax. This difference goes away.",

Now with the changes proposed, the dividend income would be tax-exempt for investors in various tax-exempt categories, for example charitable trusts, mutual fund schemes and individuals in the tax-exempt slab. Let us understand one important difference between dividend distribution tax (old regime) and the tax on dividends in the hands of investors (new regime).

In the normal course, one would expect that a loss in one head of income can be adjusted (set off) against gains in another head of income, since a person is liable to pay tax on the total income for the year. However, there are limitations to such set-off. A few key provisions here are: \u2022 Capital loss, short term or long term, cannot be set off against any other head of income (e.g., salaries). \u2022 Short term capital loss is to be set off against short term capital gain or long- term capital gain.",

Several other factors go into taxation or tax exemption. However, there are certain limits to the setting-off in case of mutual funds. This is discussed below. Bonus Stripping Suppose an investor buys units of a scheme at Rs. 30. Thereafter, the scheme declares a 1:1 bonus issue i.e., the investor receives 1 new unit, for every unit that was bought earlier. Logically, the NAV of the scheme will halve, and it is likely that the units would now have a value of Rs. 15. At this stage, if the investor sells the original unit at Rs. 15, a loss of Rs 15 is incurred [Rs 30 (original purchase price for the Units) minus Rs 15 (currently realised)].",

In such cases, the capital loss will be treated as the cost of acquisition of the bonus units. 8.6 Securities Transaction Tax When an investor sells units of an equity fund in the stock exchange, or offers them for re- purchase to the fund, he will have to incur Securities Transaction Tax (STT) i.e., STT is applicable only on redemption/switch to other schemes/sale of units of equity oriented mutual funds whether sold on stock exchange or otherwise.

The benefit is available up to Rs. 1.50 lacs per year per taxpayer in case of individuals and HUFs. The scheme has a lock-in period of three years from the date of investment. Let us now understand some nuances of this. First, this is one of the eligible investments under Section 80C, where the limit is to be shared across the eligible avenues.

The lock-in for the entire amount would not get over on completion of 3 years from the date of the first SIP instalment. Third, if one opts for (dividend) Income distribution cum capital withdrawal reinvestment plan, each time a dividend is reinvested, the same would also attract a 3-year lock-in. Most AMCs have done away with this option in case of ELSS. They only allow growth option or dividend pay- out.

A parallel tax structure has been announced in Union Budget 2020, which has more slabs, and lower rates of taxes for similar slabs. However, under the new regime, most exemptions have been removed. Those who opt for this new structure would not be able to take the benefit of tax-saving under Section 80C.

Since the distribution services involve charges with respect to the various services provided by the distributor, any investor going direct is assumed to have decided not to avail those services. In such a case, the investor may not bear the cost of such services. Each mutual fund has to offer two plans to the investors, viz., regular plan and direct plan.

Investors can therefore opt for the safer route of offering for re-purchase a constant value of units over a period of time.

The Scheme Information Document (SID) highlights two broad categories of risks, (1) standard risk factors, and (2) specific risk factors. The standard risk factors are the risks that all mutual fund investments are exposed to whereas there are certain risks specific to the individual asset category.

Interest Rate Risk Fixed income securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, money market instruments and derivatives run price-risk or interest-rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of existing fixed-income securities fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices depends upon the coupon and maturity of the security. It also depends upon the yield level at which the security is being traded. Derivatives carry the risk of adverse changes in the price due to changes in interest rates. Re-investment Risk The investments made by the Scheme are subject to reinvestment risk.",

The returns to an investor are primarily from appreciation in the value of the asset. The risk to the investor arises from the absence of defined and fixed returns from these investments that can be volatile from period to period. The returns from equity are linked to the earnings of the business. Not all businesses are successful and manage to earn return for its equity investors.

Two primary strategies adopted by the portfolio managers are security selection and market timing.  239 Security selection is an attempt to select good quality securities that are likely to perform well in the future, as well as avoid those securities where the future may be bleak.

Technical Analysts believe that price behaviour of a share over a period throws up trends for the future direction of the price.

Primarily there are two risks impacting the debt securities, viz., interest rate risk and credit risk. The yields on debt securities tend to move up as the maturity rises (interest rate risk rises), or as the credit risk is increased. Investment in a debt security, entails a return in the form of interest (at a pre-specified frequency for a pre-specified period), and repayment of the invested amount at the end of the pre-specified period.

Subsequently, yields in the market for similar securities rise to 9 percent. It stands to reason that the security, which was bought at 8 percent yield, is no longer such an attractive investment. It will therefore lose value. Conversely, if the yields in the market go down, the debt security will gain value. Thus, there is an inverse relationship between yields and value of such debt securities, which offer a fixed rate of interest.

Hence, there is no question of taking the interest rate risk. On the other hand, when the limits are not tightly defined, the fund manager may assume an active role in managing the risk, e.g., an ultra-short term debt fund may take credit risk, since the SEBI regulations only define the permitted maturity profile, which indicates how much interest rate risk the scheme can take. Dynamic bond fund is a category where the fund manager may take a view on the interest rate movements and positions the portfolio to benefit out of it.

The gold prices move on account of the  246 demand-supply balance or imbalance as well as the general view on the price of the asset. Gold is a truly international asset, whose quality can be objectively measured. The value of gold in India depends on the international price of gold (which is quoted in foreign currency), the exchange rate for converting the currency into Indian rupees, and any duties on the import of gold.

Similarly, institutions like the International Monetary Fund have large reserves of gold. When they come to the market to sell, gold prices weaken. Purchases of gold by large countries tend to push up the price of gold. Strength of the Rupee Economic research into inflation and foreign currency flows helps analysts anticipate the likely trend of foreign currency rates.

Such funds simply invest in gold and hence there is no risk related to the decisions taken by the fund management team. 10.3.4 Factors affecting performance of Real Estate funds Unlike gold, real estate is a local asset.

The inflows can be from periodic payouts such as interest from fixed income securities and dividends from equity investments and gains or losses from a change in the value of the investment. The calculation of return for a period will take both the income earned and gains/loss into consideration, even if the gains/loss have not been realized. 10.4.1 Simple Return Suppose you invested in a scheme at a NAV of Rs. 12.

The difference between Rs 13,310 and Rs 13,000 is the effect of compounding. Longer the period of investment holding, higher would be the difference, if compounding is not considered. Compounded return can be calculated using a formula: (Later Value / Initial Value) ^(1/n) - 1 Where: \u2018n\u2019 is the period in years.

The second dividend of Re. 1 per unit, on the revised unit-holding of 1,080 units would amount to Rs. 1,080. If this amount were re-invested in the same scheme at the ex-dividend NAV, then you would have 72 additional units (Rs. 1,080/Rs. 15, reinvestment at the ex- dividend NAV).

Therefore, to measure risk, generally the periodic returns (daily/weekly/fortnightly/monthly) are first worked out, and then their fluctuation is measured against the average return.

Beta less than 1 is indicative of a company or scheme that is less risky than the market. An investment with a beta of 0.8 will move 8 percent when markets move by 10 percent.

Government securities do not have a credit risk. Similarly, cash and cash equivalents do not have a credit risk. Investments in corporate issuances carry credit risk.

Historically, in the Indian markets, the dividend yields at the index levels have ranged from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, most of the times. 11.3 Basis of choosing an appropriate performance benchmark The selection of the benchmark for performance comparison must also be done keeping these in mind.",

In the reverse case, the initial premise would be that the fund manager under-performed. Such premises of outperformance or under-performance need to be validated through deeper performance reviews. AMCs and trustees are expected to conduct such periodic reviews of relative returns, as per the SEBI Guidelines. Relative returns comparison is one approach towards evaluating the performance of the fund manager of a scheme. A weakness of this approach is that it does not differentiate between two schemes that have assumed different levels of risk in pursuit of the same investment objective.",

An alternative approach to evaluating the performance of the fund manager is through the risk reward relationship. The underlying principle is that return ought to be commensurate with the risk taken. A fund manager, who has taken higher risk, ought to earn a better return to justify the risk taken. A fund manager who has earned a lower return may be able to justify it through the lower risk taken. Such evaluations are conducted through Risk-adjusted  273 Returns.

This workbook focuses on three metrics, which are more commonly used in the market. 11.7.1 Sharpe Ratio Sharpe ratio is a very commonly used measure of risk-adjusted returns. An investor can invest with the government and earn a risk-free rate of return (Rf). T-Bill index is a good measure of this risk-free return. Through investment in a scheme, a risk is taken, and a return is earned (Rs). The difference between the two returns i.e., Rs\u2013 Rf is called risk premium. It is like a premium that the investor has earned for the risk taken, as compared to government\u2019s risk-free return. This risk premium is to be compared with the risk taken.

Sharpe Ratio is effectively the risk premium generated by assuming per unit of risk. Higher the Sharpe Ratio, better the scheme is considered to be. Sharpe Ratio comparisons can be undertaken only for comparable schemes. For example, Sharpe Ratio of an equity scheme cannot be compared with the Sharpe Ratio of a debt scheme. 11.7.2 Treynor Ratio Like Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio too is a risk premium per unit of risk.

By definition, the market has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than the market, the stock's beta is less than 1.0.

Earlier it was used as a measure of how closely an index fund tracked the returns from the benchmark to which it was indexed. The tracking error was expected to be zero. Now, the tracking error is used to measure how consistently a fund is able to out-perform its benchmark. It is not enough if the fund is able to generate a high excess return, it must do so consistently. Tracking error is calculated as the standard deviation of the excess returns generated by the fund.

It is popularly believed that younger investors have the potential for taking higher risks compared to old people. However, this may not be correct as different investors have different financial goals at different age levels. In fact, investors in the same age group may also have different goals.

Growth or Value funds Equity fund managers adopt various different styles of selection of stocks. The most popular among these are the growth style and the value style. Funds that follow the growth strategy seek to identify companies that are expected to grow at rates higher than the average economic growth rate. Stocks of such companies tend to do well in a bull phase in the markets. However, in a market downturn the price of such stocks tends to fall much more too, making them riskier. Value strategy seeks to identify stocks that are available at a price that is seen as cheap relative to the value that could be unlocked in the future.",

Investors need to be particularly careful about the cost structure of debt schemes, because in the normal course, debt returns can be much lower than equity schemes. Similarly, since index funds follow a passive investment strategy, a high-cost structure is questionable in such schemes. Risk, return and risk-adjusted returns as parameters to evaluate schemes were discussed earlier in this chapter. These form the basis for mutual fund research agencies to assign a rank to the performance of each scheme within a scheme category (ranking). (See Box 12.1) Some of these analyses cluster the schemes within a category into groups, based on well-defined performance traits (rating).",

Investors should understand the broad parameters, before taking decisions based on the ranking/rating of any agency. Some research agencies follow a star system for the rating. Thus, a 5-star scheme is better than a 4-star scheme; 4-star scheme is better than 3-star, and so on and so forth. However, in such a case, it is important to understand the rating methodology, and to also check whether the rating agency claims of ratings are an assessment of the past performance or indicative of the future performance of the scheme.",

Quarterly performance ranking of schemes over a period of time shows that the best ranking fund in a quarter is not necessarily the best ranking fund in the next quarter. Therefore, seeking to be invested in the best fund in every category in every quarter is neither an ideal objective, nor a feasible target proposition.

The investor also needs to remember that beyond performance of the scheme, taxes and exit loads make a big difference to the investor\u2019s return. 12.5 Selecting options in mutual fund schemes The underlying returns in a scheme, arising out of its portfolio and cost economics, is what is available for investors in its various options viz.

Re-purchase transactions are treated as a sale of units by the investor. Therefore, there can be an element of capital gain (or capital loss), if the re-purchase price is higher (or lower) than the cost of acquiring those units.

It should however be kept in mind that even in a mutual fund scheme with a monthly pay-out option, dividend declaration is a function of distributable surplus. If there is no surplus to distribute, dividend cannot be declared. Therefore, the investor is not assured of dividend in the scheme even when there is a monthly dividend option. It is for this reason, that the need for regular income is better met through a SWP for the requisite amount. Sale of units under an SWP may have STT implication (equity schemes) and capital gains tax implication (equity and debt schemes).",

Thus, Income distribution cum capital withdrawal (dividend) option is not preferable, except in case of tax-exempt investors. As seen earlier, SWP can take care of any need for a regular income. The capital gains tax impact however, would need to be checked. Thus, taxation and liquidity needs are a factor in deciding between the options. The distributor needs to understand the investor\u2019s situation before deciding on the suitability of the option. 12.6 Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts while selecting mutual fund schemes While selecting the mutual fund schemes, there are few things that a mutual fund distributor must keep in mind.",

The safety of money is of critical importance here. Whereas, when one invests money, the primary objective typically is to earn profits. The important point to note here is that there is a trade-off between risk and return. The other difference is evident from the dictionary definition of \u201csaving\u201d \u2013 reduction in the amount of money used. This definition refers to reducing consumption so that some money is saved. It is this saved money that can be invested.

In addition to these, there are few more parameters such as convenience, ticket size (or the minimum investment required), taxability of earnings, tax deduction, etc. These factors have been discussed below: Safety: This begins with the safety of capital invested. However, one could stretch that to also include the degree of surety of income from investment. In order to understand the safety of an investment, it is important to understand the risks involved.

Is it possible to liquidate part of the investment or is it necessary to sell the whole thing? Returns: As seen earlier in the definition of investments, the major purpose is to get some returns from investment. Such returns may be in the form of regular (or periodic) income, also known as current income; and capital appreciation, or capital gains. The current income is receivable periodically, without having to sell the investment, whereas the capital gains can be realized only when one sells the investment.

Convenience: Any investment must be evaluated in terms of convenience with respect to investing, taking the money out \u2013 fully or partially, as well as the investor\u2019s ability to conveniently check the value of the investment, as well as to receive the income. Ticket size: What is the minimum amount required for investment? There are some avenues where an investor can start investing amounts as small as Rs. 50 or Rs. 100, whereas some require more than Rs. 1 lakh, and sometimes more than Rs. 1 crore. This becomes an important factor while taking a decision about selection of investment options.",

Some investors (though a very small number) have started considering certain investments (requiring large amounts), only because they could afford the same, without checking whether they needed it, or if that was appropriate for their situation and goals. Taxability of income: What one retains after taxes is what matters, and hence, taxation of the earnings is another important factor that one must consider. While looking at the taxability of income, it is critical to evaluate various other factors, too, and not look at taxation in isolation. For example, some products may offer lower tax on investment returns, but the safety also may be low.",

In other words, if the investor sells the investment before maturity (or a certain minimum period), the investment returns may be taxable. Tax deduction: A related matter is the tax deduction that may be available in case of certain products. Such a deduction effectively increases the return on investment, since the same is calculated after factoring the net amount invested.  13 However, where a deduction is available, the product may have a lock-in period of certain years. Once again, this is a trade-off between liquidity and tax deduction.",

However, as mentioned earlier, no factor should be seen in isolation. One also must consider the investor\u2019s situation while evaluating the avenues. 1.2 Different Asset Classes Various investment avenues can be grouped in various categories, called asset classes. An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics. There are four broad asset categories or asset classes, and then there are various subcategories, within each of these. The four broad categories\u2014 Real estate, Commodities, Equity and Fixed income. Out of these, real estate and commodities are also called real assets, whereas equity and debt are called financial assets.",

The real assets are available in physical form, whereas the other two would only be available in financial form. Below is a discussion on the characteristics of each of the four asset categories, along with the pros and cons. 1.2.1 Real estate Real estate is considered as the most important and popular among all the asset classes. However, the popularity of this asset category is largely because of a reason not related to investment. For those who have bought their own houses, it is the largest expense in life. The word used here is \u201cexpense\u201d, and not \u201cinvestment\u201d.

This should not be considered as investment, since selling the same may have a negative impact on one\u2019s lifestyle. Real estate could be further classified into various categories, viz., residential real estate, land, commercial real estate, etc. As an asset category, real estate exhibits certain traits, some of which are listed as under: \uf0b7 Location is the most important factor impacting the performance of investment in real estate \uf0b7 Real estate is illiquid \uf0b7 It is not a divisible asset \uf0b7 One can invest in physical real estate, as well as in financial form \uf0b7 Apart from capital appreciation, it can also generate current income in form of rents \uf0b7 In case of real estate, the transaction costs, e.g. brokerage charges, registration charges, etc. are quite high.",

These expenses are also quite high, and cannot be ignored. 1.2.2 Commodities This is another asset category that people at large are familiar in various ways. On a regular basis, people consume many commodities, e.g. agricultural commodities like spices; petroleum products such as petrol and diesel; or metals like gold and silver. However, it is not possible to invest in most of these, as many of these are either perishable and hence cannot be stored for long, or storage of the same could take a lot of space, creating different kind of difficulties.",

In this manner, these two are globally accepted assets. Both these commodities have been used as investments or storage of value for long. In fact, the history of currency would be incomplete without mention of these two. Gold has also been considered by many as a safe haven asset.

However, this so-called gold standard has been done away with few decades ago. And still, most of the central banks hold gold in their reserves. An investor in these commodities would have to count only on capital appreciation, since these do not generate any current income. Gold and silver come in varying degrees of purity. Each one can be bought at different prices from the market. However, for a large majority of investors it is almost impossible to make  15 out the level of purity.

There could also be some interest payable on the amount borrowed. There are various forms of borrowing, some of which are through marketable instruments like bonds and debentures2. There are many issuers of such papers, e.g. Companies, Union Government, State Governments, Municipal Corporations, banks, financial institutions, public sector enterprises, etc. Many bonds pay regular interest, thus the investors can expect current income. At the same time, if someone has invested at the time of issuance of the bond and hold the same till maturity, in almost all cases, there would be no capital gains.",

When one buys the shares of a company through secondary market, the share price could be high or low in comparison to the fair price. Historically, equity investing has generated returns in excess of inflation, which means the purchasing power of one\u2019s money has increased over the years. It has also delivered higher returns than other investment avenues, most of the times, if one considers long investment periods. 2 We would use the two words bonds and debentures interchangeably in this discussion.  16 Apart from long term capital appreciation, equity share owners may also receive dividends from the company.",

To sum up, equity share prices generally fluctuate a lot, often without regard to the business fundamentals. However, over long periods of time, the share prices follow the fortunes of the firm. If the profits of the company continue to grow over the years, the share price follows. There are similarities and differences between the various asset categories.

This may happen on account of death of the earning member or health issues.

At the same time, every once in a while there are expenses that one has to incur, which are far more than the income for the period. These needs can be met by investing the regular monthly surplus in some investment products. 1.3.4 Retirement needs  19 This is a phase of life when the income stops, but the expenses continue.

Goal setting is a very important exercise, while planning for investments. As seen above, all the financial goals are about the need of money that cannot be fulfilled through the inflow at that time. While the expenses for the goal may be high or low, the income (from salary, professional fees, etc.) may be less than the amount required to fund the goal.

Having said that, it is only the individual and the family that can decide which is which. A financial advisor or a mutual fund distributor may only guide and help one take an appropriate decision. At the same time, the role of such an intermediary could be very important. After that, one needs to assign a timeline as well as amount of funding required at the time of such events.

In the process of planning, this is an important question: How much would it cost? Well, this question must be answered in terms of amount needed when the goal is due.

Let us also assume that the cost of fund management is 2% p.a.4 This means if one is able to generate 12% p.a. by investing oneself, the mutual fund scheme would return 10% p.a. net of the fund management charges. On a portfolio of Rs. 10 lakhs, this amounts to a saving of roughly Rs. 20,000 for the year. Is it worth spending the amount of time one is required to spend for this saving?",

The money that is raised from investors, ultimately benefits governments, companies and other entities, directly or indirectly, for funding of various projects or paying for various expenses. The projects that are facilitated through such financing, offer employment to people; the income they earn helps them buy goods and services offered by other companies, thus supporting projects of these goods and services companies. Thus, overall economic development is promoted. As a large investor, the mutual funds can keep a check on the operations of the investee company, and their corporate governance and ethical standards.

Mutual funds can also act as a market stabilizer, in countering large inflows or outflows from foreign investors. Mutual funds are therefore viewed as a key participant in the capital market of any economy. 2.1.2 Investment Objectives of Mutual Funds Mutual funds seek to mobilize money from all possible investors.

Recurring Expenses The fees or commissions paid to various mutual fund constituents come out of the expenses charged to the mutual fund scheme. These are known as recurring expenses. These expenses are charged as a percentage to the scheme\u2019s assets under management (AUM). The scheme expenses are deducted while calculating the NAV. This means that higher the expenses, lower the NAV, and hence lower the investor returns. Given this, SEBI has imposed strict limits on how many expenses could be charged to the scheme. For running the scheme of mutual  28 funds, operating expenses are also incurred.

Further, if the scheme is open to receiving money from investors even post-NFO, then such contributions from investors boost the AUM. Conversely, if the scheme pays any money to the investors, either as a dividend or as consideration for buying back the units of investors, the AUM falls.

There are several aspects to such professional management viz. investing in line with the investment objective, investing based on adequate research, and ensuring that prudent investment processes are followed.

Affordable Portfolio Diversification Investing in the units of a scheme provides investors the exposure to a range of securities held in the investment portfolio of the scheme in proportion to their holding in the scheme. Thus, an investor can get proportionate ownership in a diversified investment portfolio even for a small investment of Rs. 500 in a mutual fund scheme.

Direct investments may require a much higher investment amount than what many investors may be able to invest. For example, an effectively diversified equity portfolio may require a large outlay.

If the same income were to be earned by the investor directly, then tax may have to be paid in the same financial year. Mutual funds offer options, whereby the investor can let the money grow in the scheme for several years. By selecting such options, it is possible for the investor to defer the tax liability. This helps investors to legally build their wealth faster than would have been the case if they were to pay tax on the income each year.  31 Tax benefits Specific schemes of mutual funds (Equity Linked Savings Schemes) give investors the benefit of deduction of the amount subscribed (up to Rs. 150,000 in a financial year under Section 80C of the old tax regime), from their income that is liable to tax.",

In a PMS, the investor has better control over what securities are bought and sold on his behalf. The investor can get a customized portfolio in case of PMS.  32 On the other hand, a unit-holder in a mutual fund is just one of several thousand investors in a scheme. Once a unit-holder has bought into the scheme, investment management is left to the fund manager (within the broad parameters of the investment objective). Thus, the unitholder cannot influence what securities or investments the scheme would invest into.",

Greater dissemination of industry information through various media and availability of professional advisors or mutual fund distributors in the market helps investors handle this overload. In order to overcome this choice overload, SEBI has introduced the categorisation of mutual funds to ensure uniformity in characteristics of similar type of schemes launched by different mutual funds.

Funds can be classified based on the  33 investment objective, as discussed earlier. We have different types of mutual fund schemes- -growth funds, income funds, and liquid funds.

This means that these schemes are structured to operate for a fixed period till the maturity date and cease to exist thereafter. Since the closure of the scheme is pre-decided, such schemes are known as close-ended schemes. Apart from these two, there are a couple of other variants, which would be discussed later.

Although some unit-holders may exit from the scheme, wholly or partly, the scheme continues operations with the remaining investors. The scheme does not have any kind of time frame in which it is to be closed. The ongoing entry and exit of investors imply that the unit capital in an open-ended fund would keep changing on a regular basis. When an investor invests money in the scheme, new units would be created and thus the unit balance would increase. On the other hand, when someone exits the scheme (fully or partly), the units sold back to the scheme would be cancelled, due to which the unit balance of the scheme would go down.",

At the end of the maturity period, the scheme is wound up, units are cancelled and the money is returned to the investors. The fund makes arrangements for providing liquidity, post-NFO through listing of the units on a stock exchange. Such listing is compulsory for close- ended schemes to provide liquidity to the investors.

Therefore, the transaction price is likely to be different from the NAV. Experience suggests that most of the time, the units trade at a discount to the NAV. This can be understood logically. The buyer has money, and hence many options to choose from, whereas the seller has the units of the close-ended fund. This puts the buyer in a better bargaining position. Interval funds combine features of both open-ended and close-ended schemes. They are largely close-ended but become open-ended at pre-specified intervals.

AMCs tend to structure the scheme around pre-identified investments. Further, being close-ended schemes, they do not accept money post-NFO.

Leading collection bankers make it convenient to invest in the schemes by accepting applications of investors in most of their branches. Payment instruments against applications handed over to branches of the AMC or the RTA need to be banked with the collecting bankers so that the money is available for investment by the scheme. Thus, the banks enable the collection and payment of funds for the schemes.

The KYC process (covered in detail later in the book) involves establishing the identity and the address of the investor.

A copy of this letter can be submitted to any SEBI registered intermediary with whom the investor wants to transact. Since the KRAs deal with sensitive investor information, they are mandated to have enough checks and balances in place to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.

The AMCs have to make use of this matrix to arrive at fair valuation of these investments. AMFI has appointed CRISIL Ltd. and ICRA Ltd.  57 for the purpose. 3.4.8 Credit Rating Agencies Credit rating agencies rate debt securities issued by various issuers. Fund managers consider such ratings as an initial input while taking investment decisions , prior to doing their own due diligence.

In case of Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), the AMC is allowed to disclose the proposed rating profile of the scheme before the portfolio is constructed. It is then mandatory to invest in debt securities only within the proposed rating profile, or less risky papers (higher credit rating than proposed).

This means the interest rate risk19 is very low in both these funds. Money market securities also have high credit rating, and hence the credit risk20 is very low. These funds are considered to be among the lowest risk funds within mutual funds.

Funds may be distributed through the traditional method of using paper-based application forms, or through electronic platforms such as websites, mobile phones and stock exchanges. Let us first look at the different categories and their characteristics. 6.2.1 Individual players India has a long history of distribution of financial products through individuals.",

Let us first look at the different categories and their characteristics. 6.2.1 Individual players India has a long history of distribution of financial products through individuals. Both Life Insurance Corporation of India Ltd (LIC), and Unit Trust of India (UTI) depended on a huge force of individual agents. While the two institutions made various products and solutions available, the agency force (i.e., individual agents) ensured these products reached the households. These same agents also distributed the small savings products, and to that extent, they played a huge role in bringing household savings into financial products. Almost all of them operated as individuals, and single-handedly, without any staff or skeleton staff, mainly to handle the paperwork. Even today, this is a very large part of the distribution link between the asset management companies and the investors.",

While the former is known as the \u201cindividual\u201d channel, the rest can be called the \u201cnon-individual\u201d channel. The traditional non-institutional channels operate through different business models. These  82 could be as under: \uf0b7 Through their own branch offices and employees \uf0b7 Through a network of sub-agents 6.2.2 Non-individual entities Non-individual entities include partnerships, regional distributors, national distributors, NBFCs, banks, stockbrokers, etc. Out of these, the distribution companies and banks are sometimes referred as institutional distributors.",

The distributor who procured the investment may have been paid an initial commission calculated as a percentage on 1000 units X Rs. 10 i.e., Rs 10,000. Later, suppose the NAV of the scheme goes up to Rs.15. Trail commission is payable on 1000 units * Rs 15 i.e., Rs 15,000 \u2013 not the Rs 10,000 mobilised.

The inflows can be from periodic payouts such as interest from fixed income securities and dividends from equity investments and gains or losses from a change in the value of the investment. The calculation of return for a period will take both the income earned and gains/loss into consideration, even if the gains/loss have not been realized. 7.1.1 Simple Return Suppose one invested in a scheme at a NAV of Rs. 12.

Hence, total return may not be an appropriate measure of return especially for investment period greater than a year.

When an investment generates simple interest, the return is earned only on the initial investment every single year. However, in case of CAGR method the interest / return earned during a period is added back to the principal amount. As a result, interest is reinvested in the asset so that interest is earned on interest. This is called the compounding effect. The impact on returns due to compounding may be marginal in the initial years but for longer periods the positive difference in returns could be jaw dropping. 7.1.4 Total return Mutual funds can offer returns in two forms; capital gains or losses and dividend.

This section would discuss the application of exit loads and the impact on transaction price. In the earlier example, the CAGR was calculated with the closing NAV as Rs. 15. However, if an exit load of 1 percent was applicable, then the investor will receive only 99 percent of Rs. 15 i.e. Rs. 14.85 on re-purchase. Thus, the investment return would be lower than the scheme returns. Loads thus drag down the investor\u2019s return below the scheme return. Even taxes can pull down the investor\u2019s post-tax returns. While calculating investor returns for a period, instead of the later value of NAV (which is used for calculating scheme returns), the amount actually received / receivable by the investor (i.e. NAV minus Exit Load, if any) would need to be used.",

The different kind of risk-adjusted returns are: (a) Sharpe Ratio Sharpe ratio is a very commonly used measure of risk-adjusted returns. An investor can invest with the government and earn a risk-free rate of return (Rf). T-Bill index is a good measure of this risk-free return. Through investment in a scheme, a risk is taken, and a return is earned (Rs). The difference between the two returns i.e. Rs\u2013 Rf is called risk premium. It is like a premium that the investor has earned for the risk taken, as compared to government\u2019s risk-free return. This risk premium is to be compared with the risk taken. Sharpe Ratio uses Standard Deviation as a measure of risk. It is calculated as: Sharpe Ratio = (Rs minus Rf) \u00f7 Standard Deviation Thus, if risk free return is 5 percent, and a scheme with standard deviation of 0.5 percent earned a return of 7 percent, its Sharpe Ratio would be (7 percent - 5 percent) \u00f7 0.5 percent i.e. 4.",

Sharpe Ratio is effectively the risk premium generated by assuming per unit of risk. Higher the Sharpe Ratio, better the scheme is considered to be.  111 Sharpe Ratio comparisons can be undertaken only for comparable schemes. For example, Sharpe Ratio of an equity scheme cannot be compared with the Sharpe Ratio of a debt scheme. (b) Treynor Ratio Like Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio too is a risk premium per unit of risk. Computation of risk premium is the same as was done for the Sharpe Ratio. However, for risk, Treynor Ratio uses Beta. Treynor Ratio is thus calculated as: Treynor Ratio = (Rs minus Rf) \u00f7 Beta Thus, if risk free return is 5 percent, and a scheme with Beta of 1.2 earned a return of 8 percent, its Treynor Ratio would be (8 percent - 5 percent) \u00f7 1.2 i.e. 2.5.",

Since the concept of Beta is more relevant for diversified equity schemes, Treynor Ratio comparisons should ideally be restricted to such schemes. 11.7.1 Information ratio Information ratio is an established financial ratio to measure the risk-adjusted return of any scheme portfolio. It is often used as a measure of a portfolio manager\u2019s level of skill and ability to generate excess returns adjusted for risk, relative to a benchmark.

The new tax rules became effective immediately. However, If the units are redeemed before July 23, 2024, the old tax rates would apply. The new tax rates would be applicable for units redeemed on or after July 23, 2024. 8.2 Capital Gains When a unitholder sells units of the scheme, the selling price could be different from the price at which the units were bought. The difference between the purchase price of the units and the selling price of the units would be treated as capital gain (or loss). If the selling price is higher than the purchase price, there is an incidence of capital gain, whereas if the selling price is lower than the purchase price, there is a capital loss. The capital gains are subject to tax. Capital gains tax is classified depending on the period of holding and the type of funds invested in.",

Relating to this, there are two important provisions that are discussed here: 1. Grandfathering of capital gains: Since the capital gains from equity assets were non- taxable till the announcement of the budget in 2018, an introduction of the tax would have meant that even the gains earned till then would also become taxable. This is equivalent to introducing tax with retrospective effect. In order to avoid such a situation, the finance minister introduced a clause, which came to be known as the \u201cgrandfathering of the capital gains\u201d. This meant that the capital gains earned till January 31, 2018 would not be taxable, which means that for all the equity mutual funds that one has invested in, the valuation as on January 31, 2018 becomes the base point.",

This means the dividends would be taxable in the hands of the recipient at the applicable tax rate. What is the change for those who opted for Income distribution cum capital withdrawal (dividend) option in mutual funds? In the new regime, tax on dividend would be a function of the applicable rate of tax based on the total income for the year, and hence the tax rate goes up for those with higher income. This means those who were in higher tax earlier might have paid a lower tax on the dividend income in comparison to their nominal rate of tax. This difference goes away.",

Now with the changes proposed, the dividend income would be tax exempt for investors in various tax-exempt categories, for example charitable trusts, mutual fund schemes and individuals in the tax-exempt slab. Let us understand one important difference between dividend distribution tax (old regime) and the tax on dividends in the hands of investors (new regime).

In the normal course, one would expect that a loss in one head of income can be adjusted (set off) against gains in another head of income, since a person is liable to pay tax on the total income for the year.

A parallel tax structure has been announced in Union Budget 2020, which has more slabs, and lower rates of taxes for similar slabs. However, under the new regime, most exemptions have been removed. Those who opt for this new structure would not be able to take the benefit of tax-saving under Section 80C.

SIP Top-up Facility Mutual funds provide an additional facility through an SIP to enhance the disciplined savings of investors. It is called the SIP Top-Up facility. Investors have the option to increase the SIP amount at intervals chosen by them. The increase can be of a fixed amount or a percentage of the existing SIP amount. For example, assume an investor has registered for a monthly SIP of Rs.2500 for a 3-year period and has also signed up to top-up the SIP at an annual frequency by Rs.500. In the first year the SIP instalment will be Rs. 2500. The second-year each monthly instalment will be increased by Rs. 500 to Rs.",

The top-up facility helps investors increase their savings with time as income and investible surpluses go up. Investors have the option to either set an upper limit for the SIP with the Top-up facility or the date from which the SIP Top-Up amount will cease.

Triggers It is not uncommon for investors to rue missed opportunities of buying or selling because they could not give the requisite instructions in time. This is addressed through the trigger option that is offered by some mutual funds. For instance, an investor can book profits by specifying that the units would be re-purchased if the market reaches a particular level. In that case, once the market reaches that level, the units would be re-purchased, without the need for going through a separate re-purchase documentation. It stands to reason that if the market continues to go up after the trigger is activated, the investor loses on the further gain.

Similarly, an investor can set a trigger to transfer money into an equity scheme when the market goes down, say 20 percent, or the transfer can be triggered by a fall in the NAV of the equity scheme by a defined percentage.

Settlement of most transactions in the stock exchange needs to be compulsorily done in demat form. In order to avail this facility, the investor needs to open a demat account with a depository participant.

I recently heard Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast with Naval Ravikant. This is a 2-hour conversation and I think this is one of the most thought-provoking and stimulating conversations I\u2019ve heard in a while. The topics discussed are quite scattered and covers a diverse set of topics, but it has a great flow to it with one thing leading to another. I\u2019m awestruck with Naval\u2019s multi-disciplinary approach to many things in life including inner peace, creativity, capitalism, and of course, wealth creation. The granular clarity he has on these topics is quite impressive.",

For obvious reasons, the wealth creation bit lingered on in my mind for a while. I was thinking about what Naval said in this podcast and it resonated with everything I have ever learned and experienced with money and my own pursuit to generate wealth. I\u2019m nowhere close to the \u2018financial freedom\u2019 state he describes in the podcast, but at least I know that I\u2019m not deviating much from the track.

A\u0205er working for a month, I got my first pay cheque ever and I was ecstatic. I felt responsible for the first time in my life. I had a bunch of things planned with my first pay.

Allow me to tell you the story of 3 sisters to help you understand why you need to start saving early in life. A father had triplet daughters. On their 20 th birthday, the father declared that he would pay each daughter a sum of Rs.50,000/- on their birthday, till they were 65 years old. They were free to use this money in whichever way they wanted. As a good father, he also suggested to his daughters that they could invest this money in a promissory note, which would pay them a return of 12% compounded year on year, with a condition that once invested, they were prohibited to withdraw that money till they turn 65.",

Here is how each daughter utilized this money \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 4  5 The first daughter started investing right away i.e on her 20 th birthday. She invested the first nine 50Ks that she received in the promissory note, and then the remaining 50K that she received (from 28th birthday to her 65th birthday) were all spent on frivolous things. The second daughter initially spent all the money she received. However, on her 28 th birthday, she got a little serious. She decided to save the same amount as her other sister. So she saved 50K from her 28 th birthday till her 36 th birthday, and the money she received from 37 th to 65 th was spent. The 3 rd sister was a bit casual till her 28 th birthday.",

So here is what I want you to note \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 7  8 The first and 2 nd sister saved similar amounts, but the di\ufb00erence was the amount of time they both gave their money to grow. The first sister gave full 45 years for the investment to grow, but the 2 nd sister gave only 38 years. See the di\ufb00erence it makes? This is the reason why I regret not starting to save early on in my life The 3 rd sister ends up with the 2 nd highest corpus, but for to that happen she had to save for a very long time. But please note, this still does not match up to the 1 st sister\u2019s corpus. So if you are someone like me, who missed savings during my early days, then the best option we have now is to save for a really long time. I hope by now, I\u2019ve convinced you why you need to start saving early.",

The concept of return and interest is very similar, just like the two sides of the same coin.

Therefore, if you understand interest, then it is easy to understand the return. In this section, you will learn about how the return is measured.

At the end of year 1, you have two options \u2013 Let Rs.20 in profits remain invested along with the original principal of Rs.100 or Withdraw the profits of Rs.20 You decide not to withdraw Rs.20 profit; instead, you decide to reinvest the money for the 2 nd year.

What if in 15 years from today, Rs.75,000,000/- is less valuable than Rs.15,000,000/-? To find the answer to this, we need to understand two thing \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 23  24 What is my risk-free opportunity cost today? Given the risk-free opportunity cost, what is the amount that needs to be invested today, such that it grows to Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years. The answer to the 2 nd question is, in fact, today\u2019s equivalent of Rs.75,000,000/- that you\u2019d receive in 15 years. So let us figure this out. We are talking about a 15-year time horizon here.

So the opportunity cost \u2013 Opportunity cost = Risk free rate + Risk premium The risk-free rate is the rate at which our money can grow without any risk. Of course, we can endlessly argue that there is nothing like a true risk-free rate, but for the sake of this discussion, let\u2019s assume that the risk-free rate is the Government\u2019s 15-year bond.

For now, you need to understand that the risk-free rate for the next 15 years is 7.5%. To figure out the opportunity cost, we can add a risk premium of 1.5-2% more.

Now that we have our opportunity cost sorted, we now need to answer the 2 nd question i.e to figure the amount that we need to invest today at 9%, such that it will grow to Rs.75,000,000/- at the end of 15 years. A trial and error method can figure this amount. Alternatively, we can use the concept of \u2018 discounting \u2019, wherein we discount Rs.75,000,000/- at 9%, which will give us the same answer. The opportunity cost at which we discount is the \u2018 discount rate \u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 25  26 By discounting we are essentially equating the future value of money (Rs.75,000,000/- in this example) to its equivalent value in today\u2019s terms, also called the \u2018 Present Value \u2019 of money.",

The present value forumla is \u2013 Present value = Future value / (1+ discount rate ) ^ (time) We know, Future value = Rs.75,000,000/- Discount rate = 9% Time = 15% We can plug these numbers in the equation \u2013 = 75,000,000 / (1+9%)^(15) = 20,590,353 This means, the present value of Rs.75,000,000/- is Rs.20,590,353/-. In other words, Rs.75,000,000/- in today\u2019s terms is the same as Rs. 20,590,353/- in 15 years. Given this, if someone makes an offer to buy the property at Rs.20,590,353/- today, then it is as good as receiving Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years, because if Rs.20,590,353/- invested at the opportunity cost of 9%, will yield Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years.

Remember, when we worked out the present value of Rs.75,000,000/- at a 9% discount rate for 15 years, the answer was 20,590,353. Now, we zerodha.com/varsity 27  28 are trying to do the exact opposite i.e compound 20,590,353 at 9% for 15 years. So the answer has to be 75,000,000.

The next month\u2019s savings can grow only for 299 months, 3 rd installment has only 298 months to grow. So on and so forth. Now, the 5 th and 6 th assumptions state that we are increasing the savings rate by 10% every January. This means, if we are starting with Rs.5000/- for year 1, the 2 nd year we bump this up by 10%, hence for the 2 nd year we invest Rs.5,500/-. This is how it looks \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 50  51 The month counting continues the same way.

So what happens a\u0205er you make these investments? Well, as per the assumption, each of these monthly investments we make, grows at 11% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate), for the respective months. zerodha.com/varsity 51  52 For example, the very first investment that we make, i.e. Rs.5000/- gets to grow at the rate of 11%, for 300 months. So what would be the value of this investment at the end of 300 months? Well, by now, you should recognize that we can apply the concept of the future value of money and get the answer. The future value of money formula is \u2013 Future value = P*(1+R)^(n) Where, Principal ( P ) = Rs.5000 Growth rate ( R ) = 11% per annum Time ( n ) = 300 months.

Hence we need to express 300 months in years, therefore 300/12 = 25 = 5000*(1+11%)^(300/12) =Rs.67,927/- Let us do this for the 2 nd installment as well; everything stays the same except for the time component \u2013 = 5000*(1+11%)^(299/12) = Rs.67,339/- This is how the table looks \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 52  53 Now, if you add up all the future values, you get the corpus accumulated for your retirement. Before I show you the number, what is your guess? Does Rs.5000/- as the starting amount make the cut? Do you think it gives you the target corpus of Rs.7Crs? If you are doubtful, then you are right.

So we won\u2019t commit this sin Increase savings, this means a frugal life today for a comfortable and financially independent life tomorrow. This is an option we can work with this.

We will now proceed to understand how a mutual fund company is structured and functions. I understand that you do not need to know about this, as long as you know how to invest in a mutual fund.

However, if you take the e\ufb00ort of knowing a little more about your camera, you may end up using your camera more e\ufb00iciently, which may perhaps result in a brilliant photograph. Therefore, in my opinion, knowing a bit about the structure of an AMC will not go waste.

You cannot wake up one day and decide to start an AMC. There are prerequisites to set up an AMC and these prerequisites are laid down by \u2018The Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019 (SEBI). SEBI is the governing authority for all the AMCs in India. SEBI holds the rights to grant or not grant the AMC license to a corporate body. The process of setting up and AMC is highly stringent and rightfully so. A\u0205er all, there is a large scale public money at stake and the regulators need to ensure this money is managed by responsible entities.

Moving ahead, we direct our e\ufb00orts to learn more about Mutual fund investing. We will learn about the di\ufb00erent fund category, fund analysis, fund schemes, and many other things associated with mutual fund investment. Now, before we learn these concepts, we need to understand a fundamental concept.

You have made a few successful stock investments, managed to score few zerodha.com/varsity 71  72 multi-bagger, called the market top and bottom couple of times, and have even managed to get a selfie with Rakesh Junjunwala at an event.

Going strictly by regulations, unless you hold the license for fund management, like the PMS license we discussed in the previous chapter, you cannot manage other people\u2019s money. Given this, assume that you apply for a fund management license and eventually procure one from SEBI.

This notional value or the initial value can be anything, and you can assign 5,10,50, or even 100 as the starting value. It does not matter.

In the Mutual fund world, this is called the \u2018 Net Asset Value \u2019. A mutual fund\u2019s net asset value or NAV is one of the most important metrics. On an end of day basis, the mutual fund company does the following calculations \u2013 The value of all the investments Expenses of running the mutual fund Based on these two parameters, the NAV of a fund is estimated daily.",

However, before I wind up this chapter, I have a question for you related to the example we used in this chapter.

I also hope you are clear about the concept of \u2018Net asset value or the NAV\u2019. The mutual fund NAV or the mutual fund unit is an elementary concept, and I hope you have no confusion about this. If yes, I would urge you to read the previous chapter once again. We will, in this chapter, take that conversation forward and look at one of the most crucial documents from a fund house, i.e. the Fund fact sheet.

The discussion will help you understand the length and breadth of the mutual fund industry \u2013 So here are necessary details for you (as on Dec 2019) \u2013 The number of fund houses \u2013 43 .

For now, think of SIP in its basic form, i.e. to invest a fixed amount of money every month in the same fund for many years. As you can see, you can SIP on Kotak Small-cap fund, but for that, the AMC has specified that the minimum SIP amount every month is Rs.1000/- and the minimum number of months is six. The next section talks about the initial minimum investment in the fund. This is self-explanatory, if you choose not to SIP, then the minimum amount to invest is Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- for the monthly SIP. The last section of the fact sheet talks about the load structure of the fund. There is a mention of few terms here like the SIP, STP, switches etc.",

The self-assessment is something that SEBI mandates to avoid cases of the misspelling of the financial product. For example, a small-cap fund should not be packaged as a low-risk fund and sold to the investors. Here is how the AMC does a self-assessment of risk \u2013 The needle of the riskometer points to \u2018moderately high\u2019, meaning that the Kotak Smallcap fund is risky. The text next to the riskometer reiterates this. Now, agreed this is a risky fund, but that should not stop you from investing in risky funds.

However, under Equity, an AMC can have multiple sectoral funds. 9.3 \u2013 Equity Category The equity category is perhaps the most popular MF category in terms of retail participation.

So go to the AMC\u2019s website and lookup for any fund you are interested in, and you\u2019ll find the portfolio details in the \u2018statutory disclosure\u2019, section. Usually, when an investor decides to invest in a large-cap fund, he has a twin agenda \u2013 (1) capital appreciation in line with the markets, (2) low volatility. By low volatility here, I mean with respect to small and mid-cap funds. In simple words, this means that the investor is looking at wealth creation but with not so much risk to his capital. Do remember, these are large-cap stocks, meant to be stable hence less volatile.",

Of course, by virtue of investing in the stock market either directly or via a mutual fund, the capital is exposed to volatility. Like I mentioned earlier, the only antidote to volatility is time. So it goes without saying that you need to stay invested for a long period to factor in the volatility and generate decent returns.

Again, when you select an ELSS fund, the decision should depend on your overall portfolio structure.

They agree to repay the borrowed amount to the lender within 50 days. PFC agrees to pay 8.5% interest (also referred to as the coupon) against this borrowing. HDFC AMC has 150Cr to invest; they see this as an excellent opportunity to earn 8.5% interest; hence they give the funds to PFC. The deal is done.

I suppose this is a relatively simple deal to understand. Like I mentioned earlier, a liquid fund by regulation can invest in debt which has a maximum maturity of 91 days. When a corporate entity borrows for such short term basis, they do so by issuing something called as a \u2018 commercial paper \u2019 or Cps. In the arbitrary PFC example I used, PFC is deemed to have issued a 50 day CP, which was subscribed by HDFC AMC.

This leads me to the most critical point about liquid funds. 11.3 \u2013 Why liquid fund? People invest in liquid funds to park cash, which they intend to use sometime soon. By \u2018sometime soon\u2019, I mean within a year or at the most within a year and a half. The purpose of this investment is to protect the capital, use it in its entirety for the purpose planned. So think about the liquid fund as a parking space for your excess funds. Question is \u2013 why to invest in a liquid fund and why not let it be in a bank\u2019s savings account. Well, people opt to invest in a liquid fund because the liquid fund offers a slightly higher return compared to the bank\u2019s savings account. The problem, however, is the fact that the liquid fund is often pitched as a better than a savings account \ue081SA\ue082 or the fixed deposit \ue081FD\ue082\u2019. This is not true at all.",

Do recall; the liquid fund is not risk-free as most people assume, it is susceptible to both default and credit rating risk. The Taurus MF and Ballarpur example highlighted this credit risk in liquid funds. Both these risk types are significantly reduced (not eliminated) in an overnight debt fund. Remember, a liquid fund invests in papers maturing up to 91 days, this typically includes both the corporate commercial papers and the Govt\u2019s treasury bills. An overnight fund, on the other hand, invests in securities which have one-day maturity. Think of this as lending money to someone for one day only.

This leads us to an important conclusion \u2013 as every overnight fund invests in TREP instrument, there is no difference between the overnight fund A and overnight Fund B.

So who would want to invest in an overnight fund? Well, this is an ideal fund for anyone looking at parking funds for a short term duration. By short term, I mean for less than three months. Remember, if you want to park funds for more than three months or 90 days, you are better off looking at a liquid fund. It is futile to look at the return aspect of an overnight fund. It does not make sense, because you don\u2019t invest in an overnight fund to chase \u2018returns\u2019, you do for the sake of convenience. However, if you are interested, as of today, overnight funds yield around 4\ue0885% annualized.

There is another interesting point to note here \u2013 while the ratings of CPs kind of vary for the money market instruments, they are all triple-A for Bonds and NCDs. Triple AAA ratings imply that the probability of default is lower. As the maturity of the bond increases, the bond manager is more worried about possible default in the bond. Hence, they tend to stick AAA rate bonds. However, this leads us to a critical point concerning ultra-short duration funds \u2013 they are not risk-free.

Before I wrap this up, I\u2019d like to give you a quick insight into the direction we are heading with this module. So far, we have discussed Equity mutual and few debt funds. The discussion is restricted mainly to a brief introduction to these funds and what happens within these funds. In the next chapter, we will continue this and introduce a few other debt funds and probably wind up the introduction bit. Once we are through with that, we will start with the fund analysis bit and figure how to select mutual funds, both debt and equity and slowly steer our way in building a goal-based mutual fund portfolio. So, we have a long way to go.",

The modified duration (measured in years) of a bond is essentially the sensitivity of the bond\u2019s price to the change in interest rate. So if a bond has a modified duration of 3.2 years, then \u2013 A 1% increase in interest rate decreases the bond\u2019s price by 3.2%. A 1.5% increase in the interest rate, lower the bond\u2019s price by 4.8% A 1% decrease in interest rate increases the bond\u2019s price by 3.2%. A 1.5% decrease in bond price, increases the bond\u2019s price by 4.8% We can generalize this \u2013 Higher duration funds have a higher sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Unfortunately, the secondary bond market in India is not liquid enough. It is not easy for the fund managers to quickly liquidate the bonds from their portfolio. For this reason, most of the bonds held to maturity.

Thanks to this episode, as investors, we now very clearly know that investing in debt fund should not be based on useless parameters such as the past returns or the current fund ranking. The market has taught us one two many times that this approach to fund selection is a pointless a\ufb00air. The evaluation must be based on risk metrics. Unless the investor develops a sense of all the risk involved while investing in a debt fund, he or she should not even venture into the debt fund arena. The same holds for equity funds as well. However, thanks to the tagline \u2018Mutual funds are subjected to market risk\u2019, investors somehow perceive market risk as a risk associated (only) with equity funds.

The recent Franklin episode formally introduced us to another dormant risk factor called the \u2018Liquidity Risk\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 166  167 We will start this chapter with a quick discussion on liquidity risk and then proceed to learn the other categories (sub) of debt funds.

Think about it for a second \u2013 on the one hand; the AMC has invested in debt papers which it cannot sell as and when they wish (lack of liquidity in bonds market) and on the other hand, it has to maintain a cash pile to service redemptions. In the event redemption comes in large numbers, the lack of cash causes a liquidity crisis. Franklin India faced this same situation. One a day to day basis, AMCs maintain enough cash to service redemptions, a\u0205er all, redemptions are a regular a\ufb00air for an AMCs.

Pay attention to the 80% part here! The remaining 20% gets invested in any paper. Suddenly what seemed like a harmless debt fund turns out tricky. This is an 80-20 cocktail, and there is a problem with it. Think about this from a regular retail investor, when he reads the fund\u2019s title; it is only natural for him to expect the fund to be 100% Banking and PSU debt, he would not expect the fund to have papers from the private sector.

Given this, the modified duration will be on the higher side for these funds. Here are the parameters for the IDFC\u2019s Banking & PSU Debt fund \u2013 The average duration is about 3.1 years, which is in line with any mid duration fund.

Similarly, a fund manager running a credit risk fund loads up the portfolio with risky papers to chase yields. Let me explain this. The objective of a credit risk fund is to take on as much credit risk as possible to ensure a higher yield to the investors. What does this mean? This means the fund will lend the investor\u2019s funds to corporates whose repayment track record or repayment capability is questionable. Why would the fund manager deliberately lend to a corporate who is unlikely to repay?

Such bonds issued by the Government were called the \u2018Gilt-edged bonds\u2019, because of golden edges.

This implies 20% can go anywhere (again the cocktail problem) \u25cfGilt with ten-year constant duration \u2013 This fund is the same as above with the added clause that the Macaulay\u2019s duration is at least ten years. By defining the duration, the entire risk profile of this fund changes.",

But think about the interest rate risk in these funds, especially the constant duration one. As you can imagine the interest rate risk is quite significant in these funds, probably large enough to compensates for the absence of credit risk. I would urge you to look into the fact sheet of any GILT fund and observe the duration and modified duration to get a sense of how risky these funds are. If you ever decide to invest in these funds, then do so only with a long, really long term perspective. I\u2019m talking about 8-10 year time frame here.

A secured debt is a loan backed by security. The classic example is a Gold loan. In a gold loan, you pledge the gold and raise a loan against it. When you repay the loan, the pledge on gold goes away, and you get back the gold. In case you don\u2019t repay the loan, the lender is free to take your gold and make good for his loss. Given this, if you look at it from the lender\u2019s perspective, a secured debt gives the lender a higher comfort compared to unsecured debt.",

We know the date of payment is the 1st December every year. The last coupon was paid on 1st December 2019, and the next coupon will be paid on 1st December 2020.

There are 100s of strategies that AMCs employ but broadly speaking, you can categorize them as: \u25cfActive \u25cfPassive In an active mutual fund, the fund manager tries to beat a benchmark or deliver alpha . In simple terms, alpha is the excess return above a benchmark. Before we go further, it\u2019s important to understand what a benchmark is and why do you need a benchmark. A benchmark serves as a point of reference for measuring performance because you cannot look at the performance of a mutual fund in isolation. Every mutual fund benchmarks itself to an index like the Ni\u0205y 100, Ni\u0205y Midcap 150, Ni\u0205y Smallcap 100, etc depending on the category it operates in.",

Benchmarks also give you an idea of the returns you would\u2019ve made if you had done nothing and just bought the index. Now, the job of the active manager is to deliver returns over and above the benchmark. He does this by actively picking stocks or based on various strategies and by deviating from the benchmark to various degrees. For zerodha.com/varsity 197  198 example, one of the most widely used strategies among mutual funds is Value investing. Here a manager tries to pick stocks that are cheaper than their intrinsic value. On the other end of the spectrum, there\u2019s growth investing where a manager invests in companies, as the name implies that is growing at a faster rate than their peers/industry and also invest most of the earnings back in the business to fuel the growth.",

Similarly, there are hundreds and thousands of approaches and strategies used by managers, which is outside the scope of this chapter, but I hope you got the idea. The job of an active manager is to beat the benchmark. A passive fund or an index fund, on the other hand, simply tracks the performance of a benchmark as closely as possible. It does not try to outperform or underperform the benchmark, but just match the returns before costs (expense ratio). Mutual funds have costs, so the return of an index fund, broadly speaking, will be the benchmark returns minus costs. So, when you invest in a Ni\u0205y 50 index fund, all you are getting is Ni\u0205y 50 returns. If Ni\u0205y 50 returns 10% this year, your return will be 10% minus the expense ratio.

The story of how the first index fund came to be is quite fascinating. John C. Bogle, also known as Jack Bogle, the founder Vanguard, launched the first index fund in 1976. The fund was called the First Index Investment and tracked the S&P 500 Index. The fund was later renamed as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. For context, the S&P 500 consists of the 500 biggest US companies, and the index is a market capitalization-weighted.",

Ni\u0205y and Sensex follow the same methodology as well minus a few technicalities. The crazy thing about the first index fund is that the launch was an abject failure. Vanguard led by Jack Bogle was hoping to raise $150 million during the underwriting process but managed to raise just $11.3 million. They didn\u2019t even have enough money to buy all the shares in the index. What they ended up doing is they sampled the index, they just bought enough stocks across sectors to broadly resemble an index, and it worked out well in the end.",

This fund alone is bigger than the entire Indian mutual fund industry, which has about $350 billion in assets.

And unlike equities which trade on the exchanges and there\u2019s transparent price discovery, most of the trading activity in bonds happens over the counter (OTC) or o\ufb00-market. It\u2019s the same even in the US, where the debt market is bigger than the equity market.

Of course, if you are a regular Varsity reader, then this is something you guys are familiar. We have discussed arbitrage on a couple of occasions, in particular, we have looked at arbitrage in the form of calendar spreads, pair trading, and put-call parity. For others who are not familiar with \u2018Arbitrage\u2019, here is a quick note. All of us, at some point in life, would have carried out an arbitrage transaction. For example, when I was in my 1st-year college, I\u2019d pay my cousin in Singapore to buy me Rock n Roll audio cassettes from Rs.100/- per tape and sell the same here in Bangalore for Rs.150/-. People here would happily buy the tape at Rs.150/- because there was no other source for them to buy these tapes. zerodha.com/varsity 209  210 The above is an arbitrage transaction.",

In an arbitrage transaction, you buy an asset (like the audiotape) from one market (Singapore) where the asset is selling cheap (Rs.100/-) and sell the same asset (the audiotape) in another market (Bangalore) for a higher price (150). The arbitrageur (i.e. me in this example), makes a risk free profit (Rs.50/- in this case). If you think about this, arbitrage is beautiful, right? If the above were to hold, all I had to do in life was buy tapes from Singapore and sell the same in Bangalore. I do this in large quantities, and I\u2019d be sitting on a massive pile of cash.

Then my money is gone, right? So the point is, unlike the popular notion, arbitrage is not risk-free. What we discussed is an example of the supply-demand risk associated with the arbitrage opportunity. But it is not just that. Imagine another scenario, where a friend of mine figures my little trick, and he does the same, i.e. buy tapes from Singapore at Rs.100/- but sells the same at a slightly lower rate at say Rs.140/- to ensure he beats me at my own game.

For instance, one of the most attractive arbitrage opportunity that the mutual fund looks for is the \u2018Spot-Future\u2019 arbitrage, wherein the futures trade at a price which is significantly away from its fair value when compared to its underlying price.

Take a look at the snapshot below \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 212  213 As of today, i.e. 18th June 2020, the stock price of Maruti is at Rs.5,714.4/- per share.

The di\ufb00erence between cash and futures is \u2013 5,735.6 \u2013 5,714.4 = 21.2 The di\ufb00erence between cash and futures is called the spread or the basis.

Once you do, you\u2019ve locked in the spread, and it no longer matters where Maruti trades because the spread of 21.6 is guaranteed. The key here is the fact that on the expiry day, Maruti in cash and Futures will trade at a single price (unlike today). The phenomenon is called \u2018Cash-Futures Convergence\u2019. So this trade has to be unwound or squared o\ufb00 or closed on the expiry day. For example, assume on the expiry day, Maruti trades at 5780 in both the cash and futures market.

Most investors apply the standard return measurement technique across all types of investment. Doing so leads to wrong return zerodha.com/varsity 221  222 calculation and therefore, wrong analysis. Return measurement is one of the key aspects while analyzing a mutual fund. We should start our discussion with the basic concept of return measurement. For the sake of this discussion, I\u2019ll assume that you are familiar with the systematic investment plan or the SIP. I guess the AMCs and the regulators have managed to do a phenomenal job at conveying the concept of SIP to every taxpayer in the country (well, all most all).

Example \u2013 I get a yearly bonus of Rs.1,00,000/-, of which I decide to invest Rs.75,000/- in a mutual fund.

Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) \u2013 SIP investments requires you to invest a fixed amount of money on a fixed monthly date in a designated fund. The investment can be weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, or even once in 6 months. For example, my very first SIP was set to invest Rs.2,500/- on 5th of every month in Sundaram Midcap fund. There is no end date to this and can go on for as long as possible. The way one measures the return for these two investments is very di\ufb00erent. Most investors take the starting and ending value of their investment and figure out what the return is. While this is one way to measure returns, this is not the only way. While measuring return, you need to factor time into consideration. For example, if I tell you that I made an 80% return on a certain investment, what would your first reaction be? I guess you\u2019d say its amazing. Now, what if said that I made 80% over 15 years? Does it look attractive?",

The calculation is straight forward. Here is an example \u2013 On Jan 1st 2020, I invest Rs.25,000 in a Mutual Fund. On July 7th, the value of this fund is Rs.30,000/-. What is the return generated?

Now that we have the Rolling Return time series starting from 2015, I can do a couple of things with the data. To begin with, we can calculate the range of returns for the time series we have calculated. To estimate the range, we simply have to calculate the max and min. Here is the max \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 243  244 And here is the min \u2013 What does this mean? Well, assume two people invested in the AB Frontline Equity fund.

Think about services like Tata Sky, Netflix, Swiggy, or even Dunzo, these are all services that you consume fairly regularly (I assume) and therefore you pay for it. Why would you pay for it? Well, because there is a real cost involved. For example, a Dunzo executive has to ride his bike to the store, pick up the item, deliver the same to your house. So there is fuel, labour, tech, and other expenses involved.

My favourite was Joy Ice cream, not because it was any di\ufb00erent than Vadilal, but because the Joy Ice cream factory was 500 meters from my house. It was a small factory with a little retail outlet at the factory\u2019s entrance. At this factory-owned retail outlet, a choco bar stick was sold at Rs.14/- whereas the same was sold at Rs.18/- in a shop called \u2018Anu stores\u2019, which still is about 1km away. Whenever my parents felt generous, they would give me some money to buy ice creams; I\u2019d run to the factory retail shop and pick up a couple of ice cream sticks for the family.",

Well, because the owner of Anu stores needed an incentive to sell Joy ice cream. Without the incentive, why would anyone sell a product, right? That\u2019s the reason Joy Ice cream as a company would mark up the price to include the shop owners incentive and sell the choco bar at Rs.18/-. However, at the factor\u2019s retail outlet, there is no incentive because the Joy Ice cream as a company would make whatever it had to make by selling the ice cream directly to the customer at Rs.14/-.

However, if you buy a mutual fund from a distributor, then it is comparable to buying the ice cream from Anu stores. Now the seller of a regular mutual fund needs an incentive to sell the mutual fund; hence the AMC marks up the TER and passes the additional TER to the distributor and the distributor network.

Benchmarking, in the mutual fund world, is used to measure the performance of a fund. To put this in perspective, think about an aspiring athlete, say a runner named \u2018X\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 262  263 X is practising hard for an upcoming running event. X\u2019s main plan is to not only win the 100 meters race but also beat \u2018Y\u2019, another aspiring runner from the neighbouring town.

A\u0205er all, Ni\u0205y 500 is diversified, has more stocks, lesser volatility, and therefore drawdowns are contained. Well, but it\u2019s not. The reason for this is interesting. Let me explain this. Imagine you have created an imaginary index, call it the \u2018High 5\u2019 index. High five consists of the top 5 stocks across five di\ufb00erent sectors. The constituents of the index are as follows \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 267  268 Each stock has a certain weight in the index. The starting value of the index is 1000; the Base Split column shows you the split of 1000 according to the weight of the individual stocks in the index. With this, assume you start your index. A\u0205er a few days, the stock prices have changed, which means the index value also varies.",

Given the stock price changes, the overall index value changes, and as you can see, the index changed from 1000 (starting price) to 1,081.72, representing an absolute return of 8.17%. Now, let\u2019s not change anything in the high five indexes, let the stocks remain the same, the reference stock prices will stay the same, and even the starting value of the index remains the same. We will only change the weights assigned to individual stocks and see what happens to the index values.

With no shi\u0205 in stocks, but with a change in weights, the returns have decreased to 5.65% from 8.17%. What does this mean? This means that the weights you assign to the stocks within an index matter the most. Whether you have 50 stocks or 500 stocks in the index is pointless, what you need to look at it the weights assigned to each stock. For example, in Ni\u0205y 500, the top 10 stock has a weightage of nearly 45%, the top 25 has a weightage close to 65%, top 50 has nearly 85-90% of the weightage.",

Well, we are talking about the risk of the returns varying from the average expected returns. Read that line again; we are defining risk as to the variation (or the variance) from the average expected returns. The variance can be both positive or negative. Let me explain, have a look at the image below \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 286  287 This is the sample daily NAV data for a Mutual fund.

The point that I want to make here is that when you take the excess return, you get both positive and negative values. A positive value indicates a profit and negative value indicates a loss.

The Sortino\u2019s ratio is an improvisation over the Sharpe Ratio, wherein the denominator has only the negative returns or the \u2018downside risk\u2019, is considered. Hence, the Sortino\u2019s Ratio is \u2013 = [Fund Return \u2013 Risk-Free Return]/Downside Risk The objective of Sortino\u2019s ratio is to estimate the excess return adjusted for only the downside risk.

If you break this down, it translates to a requirement of Rs.40L (adjusted to inflation) in 15 years 2. Identification of funds to help you achieve the financial goal 3. Periodic review and maintenance of the portfolio. In my view, the first and third point is fairly easy. It\u2019s the 2nd point, i.e. the actual act of building a portfolio is the tricky bit. If you isolate just the 2nd point, then you will realize that it is made up three things \u2013 \u25cbAnalyze funds, pick the right ones and avoid investing in the bad ones \u25cbFigure the portfolio composition \u2013 just equity, just debt, a mix of equity and debt etc.",

In this chapter, we will discuss a simple technique using which you can analyze an equity mutual fund. Think of this as a template; you can apply the same to all equity funds.

The red square belongs to the benchmark, and from its positioning in the matrix, we can conclude the benchmark has generated a return of 10% by taking the risk of 19%. Now, look at the yellow button; it belongs to the category. We can see that the yellow button is on the same vertical plane as the red square. Hence we can conclude that the average category risk is similar to that of the benchmark\u2019s risk, i.e. 19%.

What about the fund in perspective? Well, the fund has a better risk-reward ratio compared to the benchmark. It seems to have generated similar returns like the benchmark by taking on lesser risk, which in my opinion is good. Remember, you are paying the fund manager for active management.

The idea was to highlight the steps involved in analyzing an equity mutual fund. Of course, towards the end of the previous chapter, we also figured that the fund was indeed good, especially when it comes to risk management. The question is \u2013 since the fund is good, should you invest in the fund and include it in your mutual fund portfolio?

However, the decision to invest in a fund (and therefore include it in your portfolio) should not stem from how good or bad the fund is. The decision to invest in a fund should come from the objective of your mutual fund portfolio. Remember, the objective serves a financial goal. Now, for example, if my financial goal is to build an emergency corpus, then investing in Equity funds may not make sense. So it does not matter how good the fund is, there is no question of investing. zerodha.com/varsity 314  315 For many, asking them not to invest in a good mutual fund may come across a counter-intuitive thought.

For example, company A wants to borrow 50Cr to fund its operations, decides to float a 5-year bond by paying an interest of 9%. AMC X decides to invest in this bond. Assuming things go smoothly, the company gets the funds, and the AMC gets the interest payment. At the end of 5 years, the company is expected to repay the principal. As you can imagine, this is fairly standard practice. The problem arises if something goes wrong with the company during these five years and the company is unable to service the interest payment on time. If things get worse, the company can even throw their hand up in the air and say, \u2018sorry\u2019, no cash to repay the principal or the interest.",

Before we proceed further, we need to understand an important aspect of the number of funds one should have in a portfolio. I\u2019ve seen investors with 10-12 mutual funds in their portfolio for a single financial goal. Usually, their portfolio will contain 3-4 large-cap funds, another 3-4 mid-cap funds, few random debt funds, and perhaps a hybrid fund tucked in. This is a classic example of a messy, directionless, and a pointless portfolio. Ideally, you need to have non-overlapping mutual funds to avoid redundancy.

If you remember from the previous chapter on index funds, an index fund tracks a market-cap-weighted benchmark like a Ni\u0205y 50, Ni\u0205y 500 etc. Just as a refresher, a market-cap-weighted index weights stocks based on their market cap (outstanding shares X current price). Higher the market cap, higher the weight in the index. Ni\u0205y 50 is an example. Similarly, there are ETFs based on fundamentally weighted indices.

For example, academic literature shows that value stocks, i.e. cheap stocks, tend to outperform expensive stocks over the long run. But cheap stocks more o\u0205en than not tend to be cheaper because they have a higher chance of going bankrupt. Or in the case of an economic downturn, value stocks will be the first ones to go out of business.

I think you need to dive deeper if you wish to allocate to these funds. There are some amazing resources on factor investing, and a cursory Google will surface them. Please dive deeper before investing in these funds. \u25cfSmart beta is just a marketing term. There is no smart beta or dumb beta. \u25cfSmart-beta funds are nothing but factor funds or funds that have alternatively weighted indices unlike Ni\u0205y 50 which is market-cap-weighted \u25cfThe live performance of factor funds can be di\ufb00erent than the indices. \u25cfFactors can be highly cyclical, and individual factors can underperform simple diversified funds or index funds for decades.",

Happy learning, -Karthik Rangappa. 29.1 \u2013 Overview In chapter 7 , we looked at what a mutual fund is and how it works. To recap, a mutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle that collects the money from various investors, invests and manages that money on their behalf. When you invest in a mutual fund before the order placement cut-o\ufb00 time, you will get the units as per the same day\u2019s NAV which is disclosed by midnight. If you invest a\u0205er the order placement cut-o\ufb00 time, you\u2019ll get the allotment of units per the next day\u2019s NAV. Basically, everything happens at the end of the day. Now, what if those mutual funds units could be traded on the stock exchange just like stocks like Reliance or Infosys? Just like a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled investment vehicle that holds a basket of securities like stocks, bonds, and commodities and trades on the stock exchanges.",

The first open-ended mutual fund in the US was launched in 1924 and is still in existence today. The first mutual fund in India was launched in 1964. Mutual funds have democratized access to stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities globally to common investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) were the next evolution of mutual funds.

AMCs usually calculate this every 10-15 seconds and publish it on their websites. iNAV = last traded price of all the securities in the ETF basket X number of shares in the ETF creation basket + cash component (i.e. cash which is not deployed in the ETF) divided by total ETF shares in the creation basket.

A creation unit is nothing but a representative basket of all the securities in the same proportion as the underlying index.

The role of these guys is to provide liquidity on the stock exchanges. You don\u2019t have to worry about liquidity in a mutual fund because there\u2019s no real-time trading. But since an ETF trades real-time on the exchange, market makers are appointed by the AMC to provide liquidity continuously.

If you are investing in multiples of 80 lakhs, you can directly contact ICICI, and they will create units, in this case, 50,000 units and credit them to your demat.

In turn, the AMC will create ETF shares and give them to the AP, who will then sell them on the exchange. Similarly, if there\u2019s a discount, the AP will buy the ETF units on the exchange and give them to the AMC. In return, the AMC will give the underlying shares of the ETF to the AP, who will, in turn, sell them in the market.

Today, in India, we don\u2019t yet have a small-cap ETF, have you ever wondered why? In the Indian markets, the liquidity quickly starts disappearing a\u0205er the 200 largest stocks. As we go down the market cap, the smaller stocks tend to have less outstanding shares, less trading volumes, and usually keep hitting upper and lower circuits.

Now if some of the underlying stocks are not liquid or have hit circuits, which is quite common in small-caps, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to create units. In such a case, the ETF will probably trade at a premium to the NAV because there will be more demand for the existing units. Not just, small-caps, even mid-cap stocks in India have liquidity issues. So, an ETF can only be as liquid as it\u2019s underlying stocks. But this isn\u2019t a problem in a large-cap ETF like a Ni\u0205y 50 ETF because these are the biggest and the most liquid stocks.

Note: Always compare the ETF price with the total returns index (TRI) and not the price returns the index (PRI). The TRI includes dividends. All the index data you see on Kite is PRI. Since ETFs track TRI indices, they reinvest the dividends which reflects in the NAV of the ETF.

Even if India did nothing spectacular or did nothing stupid to degrow, then under a decent real GDP growth rate (and slow down in developed countries), the GDP rank is bound to increase. zerodha.com/varsity 416  417 No think about a growing GDP plus the largest democracy globally, and top it up with a large working population; what do you expect?

The di\ufb00erence between the revenue and expense, if positive, results in a profit to the company.

Remember, when GST is charged, a portion goes to the state and a portion to the centre. Hence when you look at 14.8LCr, this is the \u2018net to the centre\u2019, which means that the actual tax collection is higher than 14.8L Cr.

Non-tax revenue \u2013 Apart from the tax revenue, the Government has a \u2018non-tax revenue\u2019 as an income source. The non-tax revenue source mainly includes the dividends paid out by the PSU companies (companies like LIC, NTPCL, ONGC, NALCO etc.), where the Government of India is a majority stakeholder. Apart from dividend income, the Government also has revenue by selling stakes in these companies, o\u0205en referred to as the disinvestment program.

Tax collection as a percentage of GDP is an important metric; remember, the higher the tax collection, the higher is the revenue, which means the probability of shrinking the fiscal deficit is higher. So what will lead to higher tax collection? Things like newer job creation, business expansion, improvement in ease of doing business, greater compliance, etc., result in higher tax collection. Again, to remind you, you need to track these numbers to understand how the country operates.
